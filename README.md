#nqueens

In my first semester, we had to solve the n-queens problem as an exercise in Racket.
Let's see what it looks like after I (almost) finished my Master's in Computer Sience.

##The Problem
The task is, to find the number of possible combinations for the placement of n queens on a 
nxn grid where no queen is able to threaten any other.
